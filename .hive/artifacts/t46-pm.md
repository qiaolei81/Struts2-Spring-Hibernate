### t52 commits added to PR

| SHA | Message |
|---|---|
| `dfc70418` | docs: rewrite README for new stack with Docker Compose quick-start |
| `27e9880d` | chore: commit hive operational artifacts through t52 final housekeeping |

These are documentation and `.hive/` metadata changes only. No functional code, test, or configuration changes.

### `mergeable_state: unstable` — Explanation

`unstable` is driven by GitGuardian's `neutral` conclusion on the new check run (`66951774833`, completed 12:32:46Z). Same advisory as before — test fixture `admin123` in historical commit `0b3e467c`. No new secrets introduced by t52.

**`unstable` ≠ blocked.** GitHub uses `unstable` when a check returns a non-`success` conclusion. The upstream maintainer is not prevented from merging. This is distinct from `blocked` (required review missing) or `dirty` (merge conflicts).

## New Finding Since t45: GitGuardian Check Run

At t45 sign-off, the GitGuardian check had not yet completed. It has now run and its result is:

| Check | Status | Conclusion |
|---|---|---|
| GitGuardian Security Checks | completed | **neutral** |

**Neutral** is GitGuardian's advisory-only conclusion. It does **not** mark the PR as failing, does not set `mergeable_state` to blocked, and does not prevent merge. The upstream maintainer will see a warning banner but no merge block.

### What GitGuardian flagged

GitGuardian flagged commit `0b3e467c` — `backend/src/main/resources/application-test.yml` — for containing the values `admin123` and `pass1234`.

**Assessment of the finding:**

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Are these production credentials? | No — synthetic test fixture values only |
| Are they used in the production JAR? | No — the file was moved to `src/test/resources/` in the very next commit (`130fe081`), excluded from the production artifact |
| Do they gate any real service? | No — used only against H2 in-memory DB in the Spring test harness |
| Is there a suppression config? | Yes — `.gitguardian.yml` committed at `fd4100b8`, with `ignored_matches` for `admin123` and `pass1234` |
| Why is GitGuardian still alerting? | The suppression config instructs the GitGuardian CLI. The GitHub bot rescanned the historical commit `0b3e467c` and re-issued the advisory. This is a known gap between CLI suppression and the GitHub bot's rescan behaviour. |
| Is this a security risk? | No. Rotating `admin123` is meaningless — it's an H2 in-memory credential that never touches any external service. |

## Advisory for Upstream Maintainer

When reviewing PR #1, the upstream maintainer (`KevinXie0131`) will see:

1. A GitGuardian bot comment citing a "Username Password" secret in commit `0b3e467c`.
2. A "GitGuardian Security Checks — neutral" check run.

**Recommended maintainer action:** The finding is a false positive on test fixture credentials (`admin123`) in a historical commit. The final state of the PR has the file correctly located in `src/test/resources/` and excluded from the production artifact. No action is required before merging — the advisory can be dismissed.

If the maintainer wishes to fully silence the alert, they may use the GitGuardian dashboard to mark the incident as "Ignored / Test Credential". This is optional and cosmetic.

## ✅ MERGE APPROVED

PR #1 is approved for merge into `KevinXie0131/Struts2-Spring-Hibernate:master`.

The GitGuardian `neutral` check is advisory only and does not constitute a product or security blocker. All functional, quality, and delivery conditions are met.

**The upstream maintainer may merge at their discretion.**
